# CouchGamingApp
A fullscreen windows app for selecting PC games with a focus on local multiplayer games (couch games)

----------

## Problem
Choosing what couch game to play with friends who may not know what each game is from the icon/banner image.

I had tried Steam 'Big Picture Mode' but it lacked any videos and was too generic. I also tried Launchbox with BigBox mode and though it had videos it was still too generic so i decided to create something specific to couch gaming.

## Requirements

### Main app
- Simple, intuitive UI to scroll through games
- Focus on Couch Games
- Show how many people can play ('? players')
- Show genre and game modes ('VS' and/or 'CO-OP')
- Show video of the game
- Launch games from the app

### Manage game detail
- Get game details automatically
- Make it easy to add new games to the collection
